    "Functional wrapper around model_pipeline class allowing for the automated identification of an optimal model and hyperparameter settings in conjunction with a greedy approach for identifying optimal preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy approach is achieved by first identifying an optimal image size, or an image size that yields the best performing model without being too large to the point where it dramatically slows down training time and potentially reduces optimal model performance. Next, a specific preprocessing methodology is incorporated across a variety of preprocessing settings. For each of these settings, our image vectors / features are preprocessed according to these settings and an optimal model is identified. At the completion of evaluating a specific preprocessing methodology, if the optimal model identified is better than the previously identified optimal model trained on resized image data, the optimal model parameters are replaced. In addition, the features this model was trained on according to associated preprocessing settings are permanently applied to the features (Greedy). This process continues with other preprocessing methodologies as defined by the user, where at each step the pipeline identifies whether any additional preprocessing steps yield an improved model given previously incorporated preprocessing steps."
